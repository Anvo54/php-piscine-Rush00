#### An e-commerce website must be able to manage the following features:
- Data management: You need to implement, either your own data management
(creation, modification and removal of data) in the format you want (ex: CSV), or
using mysql. The data management is a key element to the design of your site.
- User management: You must be able to create and delete a user account. The
login to your site is essential before one can validate your basket, however, it can
be possible to fill it before being identified. To do that, look at PHP sessions.
- A basket: It must contain the list of products that your client wants to buy, the
price and the quantity of each article, as well as the total cost. It must have a
validation button to archive the order.
- Categories and associated products: As for any e-commerce website, it requires
to be able to organize the products by categories. So, one category can contain
multiple products, but one article can belong to multiple categories. It’s up to you
to conceptualize your data base before your start.
- A landing page: That page is the showcase of your website, it must be attractive
and intuitive so that your clients will want to buy. For that, the page can contain

the connection section, the account creation, the basket and a preview of a few
articles and categories. The organization of your modules will improve the user
experience.
- Administrative section: In this section, we are asking come up with a way to
give an exclusive access to some users. Those users will be able to manage the
content of your site (add, modify, remove articles, categories and users)..
In summary, a user must be able to register, connect, add articles in his basket and
validate his order. Once validated, the order must be visible from the administration
section..
